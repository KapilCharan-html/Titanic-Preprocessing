⚙ Preprocessing Steps

1. Missing Value Handling

Imputed missing values for numerical and categorical columns.



2. Encoding

Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.



3. Normalization

Scaled numerical features using standardization or min-max scaling.



4. Outlier Removal

Detected and removed outliers using statistical techniques.
